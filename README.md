# Front-end Coding Standards and Best Practices

This document contains guidelines and best practices for the front-end development team at Backbone.

## Overview

The goals for creating this document are to:

- Produce code of a consistent quality across all projects / offices
- Streamline process of collaborating with multiple developers or agencies on the same project at the same time in the same way
- Write dynamic code that can evolve and grow
- Produce code that is less prone to bugs and regressions, is easier to understand and debug

This document will be updated regulary to reflect development trends and to suit the needs of what we do at Backbone.

## General Development Standards

For all projects:

- Consistency and naming conventions between team members is crucial. Developer must ensure that all codes/comments can be reasonably easy to interprete and pick-up by other team members.
- Solutions should be as simple and clear as possible. They should serve specific purpose and can be maintain or expand over time.

### Code Consistency

The usage of the same development pattern is critical and beneficial to our team members. It allows us to quickly understand code, provide or implmenent solutions. It also simplifies debugging which, as a result, speeds up development process.

It is highly recommended to establish environments, tools used before or at the start of a project.
